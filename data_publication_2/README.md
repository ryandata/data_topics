**Data Publication 2**

Sharing your data and code is the essential step in maximizing the impact and usefulness of your research.

This workshop first reviews repositories for data publication such as Dataverse, ICPSR, OSF, Zenodo, and more. Then we turn to a detailed discussion of building R packages.

R Packages are an excellent way to distribute collections of data and code.  Following on the release of the 2nd edition of Hadley Wickham's [_R Packages_ book](https://r-pkgs.org), this workshop reviews the package creation process, covering prerequisites, the steps involved in creating a complete package, and following up on documentation and testing.
